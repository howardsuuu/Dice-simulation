# Dice-simulation
I created a game called Roll-Dice-100, when ever a player rolls a dice to get an result of 1 to 100. If the player rolls anything from 1 to 51, the house wins, but if the number is from 52â€“100, the player wins.
I use python to create this game, there are serval strings in the program: 1. Total money : The money the player is starting with ($10,000)
2. Wager Amount : The money the player bets in each round ($100)
3. Number_of_plays : The number of times that the player plays (The variable we want to examine)
